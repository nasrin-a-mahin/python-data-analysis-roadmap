## 🔄 Extended Roadmap (Industry-Aligned Skills)

After completing the initial 30-day Python Data Analysis plan, this roadmap was extended to cover essential real-world Data Analyst skills.

### 📊 Week 5 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- EDA process and mindset
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Univariate & bivariate analysis
- Correlation analysis
- Business-focused insights

**Mini Project:** EDA on sales or customer dataset

---

### 🛠 Week 6 — Feature Engineering (For Analysts)
- Creating business-driven features
- Date & time feature extraction
- Binning and categorization
- Aggregations and ratios
- Feature interpretation (not ML-focused)

**Mini Project:** Feature creation for customer analytics

---

### ⏳ Week 7 — Time Series Analysis (Analyst Level)
- Datetime handling in Pandas
- Trend & seasonality analysis
- Rolling averages and growth metrics
- Month-over-month / Year-over-year analysis
